Our laptop fan cleaning services are vital for ongoing computer health. If your machine is older than two years, and has never had its fans cleaned, it’s likely to need them doing.</p>
                                <p class="py-3">Your laptop fan is responsible for cooling the vital components packed tightly inside the case. It blows the hot air, generated by the working elements of the computer, out through the air vents. But air isn’t the only thing passing through those vents. Over time, tiny particles of dust and dirt, sucked into the machine by the action of the fan, clog up the blades.</p>

                                <p class="py-3">The cooling fan is a vital element of your laptop’s heat removal system. It’s responsible for removing the hot air generated by the processor and other parts. In modern laptop designs, air is usually removed from heat sources using a ‘heat pipe’ system, which delivers the exhaust to the fan to be blown out through the cooling vents. Because everything in your laptop is packed together so tightly, a broken or faulty fan is a critical issue.</p>

                            <p class="py-3">If your cooling system goes, an expensive laptop can become junk in just a couple of hours. Our fan repair services are here to stop that happening.</p>
